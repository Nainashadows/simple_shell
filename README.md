Simple shell 

Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

Usage: simple-shell

Your Shell should be able to:

Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.

The prompt is displayed again every time a command is executed.

The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.

The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.

If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again
